<h2>
Definitions

<h4>
Abstract syntax tree (AST)
</h4>

<div>
 An abstract syntax tree (AST) is a tree representation of the abstract syntactic structure of source code written in a programming language.
</div>

<h4>
Interpreter
</h4>

<div>
 This is the part that turns the AST into action. Action meaning making the computer do what the AST said to do based on the rules of the language.
</div>

<h4>
Standard out
</h4>

<div>
Usually the main output of a console. Some place specified for most output of the program to go.
</div>

<h4>
The Primitives
</h4>

<div>
The basic built in types of the langauge including: Floats, Strings, Lists and Booleans
</div>
