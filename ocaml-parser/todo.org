** Decissions / Questions?
*** How Pure to be?
*** How am I going to execute this crap?
**** Strieght OCaml :thisone:
**** Convert to some other language?
Is this legit? or does it go against what I said to do?
***** JS
***** Clojure
***** C?

this may require some sort of stack

**** How to store state?
***** Map that's passed along
***** Monad? <- most likely
**** How to deal with stuff that doesn't type check :P
***** Polymorphic functions?
***** Just throw errors <- Most likely

HOW?
**** Create a scope that you can pass around?
***** Preferably one that thinks about functional scope 
*** TODO Define functions
*** TODO Run Defined functions
**** Global
*** TODO Equality for Lists
*** TODO Equality for strings
*** TODO Be able to parse and execute in 1 second
*** TODO debug  mode                                                 :maybe:
*** TODO write tests for all of the below

**** NOTE: this may require to store lbp/rbp in the monad.
which may be less cle
*** TODO don't use exceptions in eval, at all.
