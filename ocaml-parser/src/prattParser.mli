 * Pratt termonology:
 * 
 *     Name: 
   *     The symbol name matches either a tokenâ€™s
   *     name or value
 *     Lbp: 
   *     The left binding power of this symbol. 
   *     Determines if it will grab the previous 
   *     expression.
 *     Nud: 
   *     The function called 
   *     when this symbol is executed with no 
   *     arguments
 *     Led: 
   *     The function called when this symbol 
   *     is executed with the previous expressionâ€™s
   *     result.
 * Questions------------
   * How do we bind operators that are afterwards?
 *)

(* Note that the token classes have several attributes 
 * (not all classes have all kinds of attributes):

    nud - this is the prefix handler we talked about. In this simple parser it exists
    only for the literals (the numbers)

    ~ OR ~

    lbp - the left binding power of the operator. For an infix operator, it tells
    us how strongly the operator binds to the argument at its left.
    led - the infix handler.
